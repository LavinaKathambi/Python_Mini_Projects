# Photos_organizer

This piece of code is used for organizing photos on your laptop by destination. 
If you have a photo problem like myself 🤦🏽‍♀️who goes around taking random photos and cat videos, you'll love it. 

PS: This is not just a photos solution, honey! you could re-use it for anything 😉 

To re-use this code is simple, just clone this code inside a folder📂  wih your photos and run 🏃‍♀️ literally!

I personally use this all the time, after I have pilled up junk on my computer 👩‍💻 

A big shout out 🗣 to Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree I learnt the basics of doing this from the class!!
